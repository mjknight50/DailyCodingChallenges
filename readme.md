# Daily Coding Problems

My attempts at some of the daily coding problems in Typescript

> To run all tests: `npm t`

## Problems

- [#1](/src/1) Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.
- [#2](/src/2) Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with places after the decimal.
- [#3](/src/3) Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
